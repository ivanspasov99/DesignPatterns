## Singleton Pattern
**Creational Pattern**

**The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.**

### Singleton Idea:
1. When you need only one instance of a class. Example: DB connection. Only one instance can have connection to the DB.
2. When you use a singleton you make sure that all of your application resources are **making use of the same global resource**
