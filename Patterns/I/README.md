## Strategy Pattern
#### Problem: ***Composition over Inheritance***

### Strategy Pattern Idea: 
1. Better **HAS A**, than **IS A**
2. Example how to(not) apply open-closed principle
3. Do not repeat code even you implement functions in different subclasses
4. Use Interfaces, cause they solve problems at all, and they are reusable for whatever the purpose is
